The folder denoted as 'left' includes all the 3D printed parts to make the motor sticking out the left when seen from the tensioner, and 'right' appropriately. If you don't know what the tensioner is, please refer to the [DM2040 Features](https://github.com/CrispyButtermilkChickenSalad/DM2040/wiki/Features). Otherwise, print it out and it should be fairly intuitive which part goes where.
